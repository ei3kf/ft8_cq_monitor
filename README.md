# ft8_cq_monitor

Small Python script that monitors the WSJT-X/ALL.TXT file for CQs, if a new station is logged calling CQ then print the details on screen.  I wanted to have some sort of method that would notify me that there was new activity on the 8M(40Mhz) amateur radio band on FT8.

ToDo
* Rather than print the CQ event to screen, push it to email or someother notification thingy so I can be alerted of a new station to work on amateur radio.
